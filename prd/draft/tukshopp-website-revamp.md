## 🎯 Problem Statement

### What problem are we solving?
Currently, TukShopp's website (tukshopp.ng) is just a basic landing page that doesn't reflect the full capabilities of the platform. This creates several issues:

2. **No Web Shopping Experience:** Users can only access the marketplace through the mobile app, limiting accessibility
3. **Poor User Engagement:** Visitors can't explore vendors or products, reducing conversion potential
4. **Missing Information:** No comprehensive information about services, features, or how the platform works
5. **SEO Limitations:** Basic landing page doesn't support content marketing or organic discovery
