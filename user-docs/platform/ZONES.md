# Zones & Delivery System

Understanding how TukShopp's innovative zoned delivery system works for maximum efficiency.

## 🗺️ What is the Zoned Delivery System?

## 🎯 How Zones Work

### Zone Definition

Each zone is designed with:

- **Geographic boundaries** - Clear service area
- **Vendor density** - Concentration of partner vendors
- **Customer population** - Delivery demand
- **Infrastructure** - Road networks and accessibility
- **Traffic patterns** - Historical congestion data

### Zone Characteristics

```
Zone A (Downtown)
├─ High vendor density
├─ High customer demand
├─ Compact area
├─ Quick turnaround times
└─ High delivery volume

Zone B (Residential)
├─ Medium vendor density
├─ Steady demand
├─ Larger coverage area
├─ Family-oriented orders
└─ Evening peak times

Zone C (Business District)
├─ Office lunch deliveries
├─ Peak during business hours
├─ Corporate clients
├─ Scheduled deliveries
└─ Weekday focus
```

```
Rider in Zone A receives:

Order 1: Restaurant A → Customer 1 (North Zone A)
Order 2: Restaurant B → Customer 2 (North Zone A)
Order 3: Restaurant A → Customer 3 (Central Zone A)

Smart routing optimizes:
1. Pick up Order 1 at Restaurant A
2. Pick up Order 3 at Restaurant A (same location)
3. Pick up Order 2 at Restaurant B (on route)
4. Deliver Order 3 (Central)
5. Deliver Order 1 & 2 (North, same direction)

Result: 3 deliveries, 1 efficient route
```
